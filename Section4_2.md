# **2. Installation of Base R and RStudio**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2.1 Why Do We Need Both Base R and RStudio?**

-   **Base R** is the engine that runs the R programming language. It’s
    like the core of the car that makes everything work.
-   **RStudio** is the user-friendly dashboard that makes working with R
    easier. It’s like the control panel of the car—making it easier to
    drive and explore what’s under the hood.

## **2.2 Steps to Install Base R and RStudio**

Here’s how to get started:

1.  **Install Base R**:
    -   Go to the CRAN website: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
    -   Choose your operating system:
        -   **Windows**: Download `R-X.X.X-win.exe` and follow the
            installation instructions.
        -   **Mac**: Download `R-X.X.X.pkg` and install it.
        -   **Linux**: Follow the specific instructions for your
            distribution.
    -   Complete the installation.
2.  **Install RStudio**:
    -   Visit the RStudio download page:
        <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
    -   Download the installer according to your operating system:
        -   **Windows**: Download the `.exe` file.
        -   **Mac**: Download the `.dmg` file.
        -   **Linux**: Follow the provided instructions.
    -   Install RStudio by running the downloaded file and following the
        setup process.

**Again, you need to do both 1&2 for you to be able to work on
RStudio.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Optional alternative: you don't need to do this if you do 1&2 already.
For iPads or those who don't want to install software on your device as
you will only need a browser like Google Chrome.**

3.  **Use RStudio Cloud**:

    -   If you're on an iPad or want to avoid installing RStudio on your
        device, you can use **RStudio Cloud**. This is an online version
        of RStudio that runs in your browser.
    -   Go to: <https://posit.cloud/>
    -   Create a free account and start a new RStudio project.
    -   You can upload your scripts and data to the cloud and run R just
        like you would in the desktop version.
    -   We do not recommend working on iPads as there will be lots of
        typing.
